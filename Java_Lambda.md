# Java Lambda

Just want to share with you how I understand Java 8 Lambda. I've been learning about it the past couple of months.

What is a lambda? They are anonymous function. Functions with no names.

In Java the way they achieve this is by wrapping it in a class with only 1 method. And it implement a Functional Interface.

Everything in Java is still an object and Java Lambda is also an object
